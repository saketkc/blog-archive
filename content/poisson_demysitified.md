Learnt it the hard way. 
This one is more of a scratch pad, inspired from 
the previously discussed problme on estimating the size of 
restriction fragments.

Notations:

$N_t$= Number of events that have happened in the $t^{th}$ time interval

$T$ = Time taken till the first arrival occurs(or the next arrival occurs since waiting time is memory less i.e$)i



Now consider the event,  $\{T > x \}$ so you had to wait $x$ seconds before your first bus came
and the buses wre coming at a rate of $\lambda$ per second.

$\{T > x\} \sim N_1 = 0$
