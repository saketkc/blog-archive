## L2 norm and spectral radius for $$A=A^T$$

L2 inducded norm:

###NOTE: L2 norm is not the same as Frobenius norm. L2 norm is an “induced vector” norm, Frobenius is a “matrix” norm.

Induced norm: $$$|| . ||$$ defined as ||A|| = $$sup_{||x=1||} ||Ax||$$ 
Note how ||Ax|| is a vector norm too, while ||A|| is a matrix norm
