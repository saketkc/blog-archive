I am Saket Choudhary. I recently graduated from the University of Southern California (USC) with a Ph.D. in Computational 
Biology and Bioinformatics. Before joining USC, I graduated with a Bachelors and Masters in Chemical Engineering from 
IIT Bombay. I also did a Masters in Computer Science and Statistics while at USC.

In my Ph.D. I developed [methods](http://doi.org/djv4) to understand translational-regulation, making it easier to separate
noise from [signal](http://ribopod.usc.edu/). I also dabble in making mundane bioinformatics task [easier](https://github.com/saketkc/gencode_regions),
streamlining [pipelines](https://github.com/saketkc/gencode_regions), and write code to enable [easier retrieval](https://github.com/saketkc/pysradb) 
of data and metadata. More broadly, I am interested in understanding transcriptional- and translational- regulation in a 
cross-species context.

Besides Github, I am also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/saketkc) and [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/saketkc).

# Why Piddling Pertinent?

Piddling = Trivial | Pertinent = Relevant 

=> Piddling Pertinent = Trivial yet relevant
